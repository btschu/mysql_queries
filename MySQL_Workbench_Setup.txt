# To Do: MySQL Workbench Setup
<!-- Use MySQLWorkbench to connect to your localhost.

Learn how to use MySQL workbench to do queries directly in the database. 
To connect to a specific database, runUSE [databasename]; in the query box.

Once you've connected the database, try the queries that you would need to make a 
CRUD application (create, read, update, delete). In other words, use the SQL commands INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

Create a text file with the commands you used to query the database. Upload the text file below. -->



USE twitter

SELECT * FROM users

INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name, handle, birthday, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES ("Brandon", "Schumacher", "bschu", "1984-03-30", NOW(), NOW());

SELECT * FROM users

UPDATE twitter.users SET handle = 'brandon.schumacher' WHERE id = 6;

SELECT * FROM users

DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 7;

SELECT * FROM users

DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 8;

SELECT * FROM users
